How To Make A Doodly Whopper
3/8" OR 1/2" brass grommet through center of 2 pieces of fabric, needs to flex easily.
6* 1/4 grommets through fabric, drill holes with electric drill and hole punch. Square pattern with equilateral triangle points on "above" and "below" square.
3* 1" key rings looped into two rings, 6 grommets, 3 rings
Trim fabric at the edges to allow the key rings to come together.
Slip flexible gel beads onto keyrings, I use 3-5 per keyring, slide as group to center of ring, to cover the sharp edge of the ring.
Assemble several swivel clips and other keyrings to make the rigging to attach, I like to use a treated 1" wooden ring too
