# doodlywhoppers
instructions to build your own :)

optimism through action. doodly whoppers are kinda like custom poi, handles attached to swivels attached to fabric shells containing LED lights. It's open source on github, you can make your own and share different versions with your friends. Doodly whoppers With handles around the wrist can keep your hands and lights off the ground. I use a hammer to connect the two brass grommet pieces, please be careful in general, also please be respectful of those around you. I hope you are able to find these materials where you are, I chose brass for properties related to rust/oxidation and bacteria growth. These can also be washed, or I have tried it without regret. When you make these, please remember that BLACK LIVES MATTER - 

assembled with a variety of materials to be durable and provide a safe toy while you move around. 


A doodly whopper: double set with 6 shells consists of: 1" stainless steel keyrings, 1.5" lobster swivel clasps, 6x 1/2" inch grommets, 24x Â¼ inch grommets (6 pairs), two handles and squishy gel beads to cover sharp edges.

A doodly whopper shell is:
At least two 4 inch diameter cuts of fabric that have been fused together with a one 1/2" grommet in the middle of the fabric, and 6 1/4" grommets round the center. These will be looped with 3 keyrings. Held by lobster keyrings that connect to handles with swivels everywhere, add LED lights for extra motivation and hopefully also rainbows

Make your own if you'd like, it is released with unlicense :)

How To Make A Doodly Whopper 
-1. take a moment to consider grandmother earth and our place on turtle island
-2. pick two pieces of fabric about 5-6" in diameter, this materal needs to flex and bend easily
-3. think about why it is important to defund SPD immediately by at least 50% and invest that money in black communities
-4. it's important to cut that police budget by at least 50%, I found it easiest to cut the corner of the fabric after folding 4 times in half
-5. use a hammer to connect the bottom 1/2" grommet piece to the thin top 1/2" grommet piece
-6. FYI before any cuts, i've found it nicest to have the 6 points arranged in 3 sets of 2, each will be different and that is OK
-7. cut 6 small holes in each fabric piece for a 1/4" grommet, folding to a point and cutting the edge 
-8. [one at a time] use a hammer to connect the bottom 1/4" grommet piece to the thin top 1/4" grommet piece, use fabric washer/circles if needed
-9. pick two 1/4" grommets, connect the 1" key ring, then add two more 1" key ring for two pairs of other 1/4" grommets
-10. Trim fabric at the edges to allow the key rings to come together and be held with a lobster clasp
-11. Slip flexible gel beads onto keyrings, I use 3-5 per keyring, slide as group to center of ring, to cover the sharp edge of the ring.
-13. Assemble several swivel clips and other keyrings to make the rigging to attach, I like to use a treated 1" wooden ring too
-14. WHOSE LIVES MATTER? BLACK LIVES MATTER

if black lives matter, prove it, out of your homes and into the streets
